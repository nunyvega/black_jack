*simplified* version of Black Jack:

- The player starts with no cards (score of 0)
- The bank starts with a score between 16 and 21
- For each round, the player can:
  - Draw a card with a random value between 1 and 11. This number will be added to his/her score.
  - Draw another, or stick with the current score and finish the game.
- In the end, there are 5 possibilities:
  - If the player's score is > 21, they lose (bust).
  - If the player's score is 21, they pull a "Black Jack" and win.
  - If the player's score is > than the bank's, they win.
  - If the player's score is < than the bank's, they lose.
  - If the player's score is == to the bank's, it's a "Push". The player gets their money back.
